238. Product of Array Except Self
Medium
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? 
(The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

There can be multiple solutions to this problem but we have to reach the required condition mentioned in the question that TC :: O(n) and SC :: O(1)

Naive solution using nested loop
For every element int the array , running the loop and calculating the product except itself -->>>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans(n, 1);
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if(i == j) continue;
                ans[i] = ans[i] * nums[j]; 
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
TC :: O(nÂ²) and SC :: O(1)
obviously did not meet the required condition as TC is very bad !!
//

Maintaining a left_product and a right_product array
This is the way towards reaching the desired solution ... 
To calculate the product of all the elements except itself for an element at the index i, 
what do we need ? Product of all the elements on the left side of it and the product of all 
the elements on the right side of it and if we multiply them both we get the answer !!
keeping this in mind, let's look at an example --->>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans(n);
        vector<int> left_Product(n);
        vector<int> right_Product(n);
        
        left_Product[0] = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++){
            left_Product[i] = left_Product[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        
        right_Product[n - 1] = 1;
        for (int j = n - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
            right_Product[j] = right_Product[j + 1] * nums[j + 1];
        }
        
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            ans[k]= left_Product[k] * right_Product[k];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
TC :: O(n) and SC :: O(n)

Left_product taken as variable and using Right_product array as ans
We have optimized the TC, we just don't need to use any extra space ... 
In the previous solution do we really need any extra space ? After maintaining the Right_prod array , 
can't we just take left_prod as a variable and then we keep updating it with left_product into 
nums[i] while iterating from left to right ... look at the example again

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        vector<int> ans(n);
        
        ans[n - 1] = 1; // ans array used as right product array
        
        for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--){
            ans[i] = nums[i + 1] * ans[i + 1];
        }
        
        int leftProd = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            ans[i] = leftProd * ans[i];
            leftProd = leftProd * nums[i];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
TC :: O(n) and SC :: O(1)
